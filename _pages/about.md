I am a second-year student pursuing a Master's degree in Mathematics (Statistics) at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule of Zurich. My academic interests encompass a wide range of subjects, including algebraic topology, statistical learning theory, time series analysis, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, computational geometry, graph theory, and formal language theory.

Throughout my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to engage in various projects that have contributed to my growth and understanding of these fields. In addition, I have worked as a teaching assistant for several semesters, where I have had the opportunity to share my knowledge and support fellow students in their studies.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I lead an active lifestyle. In my free time, I enjoy weightlifting training, bouldering, and engaging in board and video games. I also have a passion for skiing during the winter months and indulge in extreme sports such as downhill mountain biking during the summer. It won't be hard for you to find me the gym in the Hönggerberg campus, particularly in the evenings.

This website serves as a repository for my academic projects, lecture materials, and a glimpse into my interests and passions. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me. I welcome opportunities to collaborate and engage in discussions related to my academic pursuits and shared hobbies.
